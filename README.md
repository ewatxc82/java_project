# ALIENS-R-REAL

# Data: 
A large dataset of UFO sightings has been collected over an extensive period of time. Specific data about each sighting is noted within the dataset such as: Date, City, State, Country, Shape of the UFO, Duration of the Sighting, and Additional Comments.

# Goal: 
The data set is too large for users to sort through manually so we need to add a filter that can filter the data via a key entered by the user.

# Output: 
We utilized Javascript, D3, HTML, and CSS to create a website that displays the data and allows the user to extract specific sightings by searching for certain data characteristics within the dataset.

Run the index.html file on a live server to view the website.
